When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you are collaborating with others on a project or if you happen to travel a lot and need to work from many locations without having access to your home computer. It would make things a lot easier from those perspectives.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because if you are collaborating with thers, then sometimes you would be pulling changes you are not fully aware of and that might conflict with some of your changes.
