What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialise a repository a new .git file is created. You need to do it so you can create your own commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is different because you can add files to the staging area before making a commit. It allows to to add or remove specific files and commit with only the relevant ones from your repository or working directory

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Because you can run git diff to compare with the last commit  by running git diff --staged and make sure you are not making a commit with too many changes

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
I think when you are creating different versions of the code that are all intended to be workable versions. And branches help as it makes it a lot easier to search through your repository and it is more logical to have the last commit in each branch to be the workable versions.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Because you can clearly see how the structure 'branches' out. You can see where different branches originated from and get a better idea of what you are dealing with

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
Well the result is you have a new file/files containing all the changes made on both branches. We represent it like this because it shows how the merge contains code from both branches

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Always doing it manually would take more time but would generally mean there would be no conflicts
